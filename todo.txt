Games to port
=============

I'm not planning any more games to port.


Bugs to fix
===========

- Running OpenGL SwapBuffers in a separate thread - huge speed improvement expected.

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- With 4:3 screen aspect ratio the on-screen buttons are not shown on the inactive part of screen.

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 several times makes it crash.

- Support of libjnigraphics (it will disable on-screen keyboard)

And that's all, I won't be doing any more development or fix other bugs (see bugs.txt for details).
