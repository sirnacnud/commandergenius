Known bugs
==========

- With 4:3 screen aspect ratio the on-screen buttons are not shown on the inactive part of screen.

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 several times makes it crash.

- Split Settings.java into several files.

- There's no double-buffered SW mode, only single-buffered.

- SDL_FillRect() does not work in SDL 1.2 HW mode.

Requested features
==================

- Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3

- HDMI output (HTC Evo and Samsung Epic support that):
HDMI output will be tricky - I've read the doc here:
https://docs.google.com/View?id=dhtsnvs6_57d2hpqtgr#4_1_HDMI_output_support_338048
It says that in order to output something to HDMI you need to have a VideoView class visible on screen:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/VideoView.html .
This class does not have any method like "showMyOwnCustomImage()",
it just plays the video from the given path, so obvious solution is to create
special FIFO file or open a socket, point the VideoView to play this FIFO or socket,
and then write raw uncompressed video frames to that FIFO with some small header so that
VideoView will recognize it as a proper video format.
UQM gives 5 FPS without such hacks, if I'll implement that FPS will drop to 1-2
(maybe not that bad, I have to actually try that), because you'll have to do huge memcpy(),
plus VideoView will contain some buffer to ensure the playback is smooth,
so the data on your TV will lag halfsecond behind the data on the device screen.

- Somehow make this port into main libSDL repository - that's rather impossible,
because the original sources are modified badly, plus Java code does not fit anywhere.
