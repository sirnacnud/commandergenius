		Simple Mixer
		------------

This is about as simple as sound mixing gets.
Four voices, stereo volume control, 16 bit
mono sounds. It needs 44.1 kHz 16 bit stereo
output. (Won't resample, convert or anything.)

There's a primitive and utterly useless
pattern sequencer in there as well - you may
just ignore that code if you don't get it;
it's not important. Or you can make a GUI for
it and learn some SDL graphics coding in the
process, maybe...

The sounds were sampled by Michael Fischer,
from a real Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer.
(A vintage analog drum machine.) Please see
README.SOUND for details. You may get the
rest of the sounds from here:

Or just use Google, if that doesn't work.
